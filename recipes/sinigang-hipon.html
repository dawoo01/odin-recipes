    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sinigang na Hipon is a Filipino main dish having shrimp as the main
      ingredient. Fresh Shrimps and vegetables are cooked by boiling in a sour
      broth. The commonly used souring agent is tamarind. However, other fruits
      such as guava, tomato, bilimbi (known as kamias), green mango, pineapple,
      and wild mangosteen (santol) can also be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to the previous sinigang dishes that we featured (Sinigang na ulo
      ng Salmon and Pork Sinigang), This variation is eaten with rice and some
      fish sauce (patis) on the side. I usually cook this dish whenever I feel
      nostalgic or when the weather is pretty cold. Like today, the temperature
      is dropping again somewhat signaling for the coming of winter.
