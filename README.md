FIRST PROJECT

This is a basic cookbook website that I've built using basic HTML.
This project showcases the basics of HTML (ie. creating a boilerplate), and making
use of html elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

This may not be the best looking website but it highlights my knowledge of the fundamentals of
website building (HTML).
